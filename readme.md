I've made this workspace to incentivize other developers to work on my open source projects (and hopefully make me give more attention to them as well).

### Project structure
```
ðŸ“¦latham-pcc
 â”£ ðŸ“‚libraries  // Your libraries
 â”£ ðŸ“‚projects   // Your projects
 â”ƒ
 â”— ðŸ“‚opensource // Open source projects
```

## Setup

You'll need pnpm
https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation

Fork, clone, whatever you want then:

Pull the open source repos
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install stuff
```
pnpm install
```

### Working on open source

- Remember to checkout to a branch and frequently check for updates
